# Blank Face chat app beta v0.7


## What is BlankFace?

BlankFace is a free and super minimalistic chat app. 

**This chat is not safe** All messages go out globally to any and all users. All of these messages are pushed to a simple empty array. The memory is volatile. After about 30min of server inactivity, it shuts down, and the "chat history" is gone forever. 

A "login" is not available. 

Anyone with the link can view all current chats. Ie if the server has been on, there will be all of the history.

This app is run _AS-IS_. I take no responsibility for what goes on here. Use at your own risk and be safe about things.

### BlankFace?

There are no guarantees or safeguards here. It is a BlankFace. No one is checking to see if it is safe here, or secure. No records are kept longer than the server keeps them. File sharing currently supported. Emoji's are not currently supported.

# Just Chat.
